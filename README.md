## üìù Overview

VOXA pairs a wearable voice-capture device with a mobile app to transform everyday conversations into rich, structured data. This unlocks powerful AI-driven services like:

- **Automatic task management**
- **Real-time meeting summaries**
- **Personalized health insights**

Underrepresented languages and heavy accents can monetize their voice data by licensing to AI firms, fostering diversity in speech AI.

## ‚ùì Problem

- 98% of the world‚Äôs ~7,000 languages are unsupported by voice AI.
- Accent and dialect variation still cause poor accuracy in major languages.
- Lack of diverse, real-world voice data hinders natural AI conversation.
